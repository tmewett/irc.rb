# Executing commands

## Channel
Prepend your command with your bots nickname followed by a `:` or a `,`
```
<you> greetbot: slap another-user
* greetbot slaps another-user with a large fish
```
Most IRC clients will do this automatically when autocompleting nicknames with <Tab>

## PM
You can also give commands to the bot directly:
```
{you} secret
{greetbot} Shh!
```
Start a PM and just send the command without the prefixed nickname.
